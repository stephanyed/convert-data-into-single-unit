This is a data transformation in Microsoft Excel Power Query.
The data is collected from each factory on their water usage from different sources and the water unit they used to measure their usage.
The unit of the water includes: m3, gal, CCF, liter etc.
We would like to standardise all the water unit to liter for analysis.
